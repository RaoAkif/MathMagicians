        When I consider what people generally want in calculating, I found that
        it always is a number. I also observed that every number is composed of
        units, and that any number may be divided into units. Moreover, I found
        that every number which may be expressed from one to ten, surpasses the
        preceding by one unit: afterwards the ten is doubled or tripled just as
        before the units were: thus arise twenty, thirty, etc. until a hundred:
        then the hundred is doubled and tripled in the same manner as the units
        and the tens, up to a thousand;â€¦ so forth to the utmost limit of
        numeration.
